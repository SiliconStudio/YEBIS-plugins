**YEBIS a post-effects middleware solution**

Briefly explained, post-effects are visual effects added during post-processing to a frame that has already been fully rendered in order to enrich its visuals. Although not unlike the process of retouching photos taken with a digital camera, post-effects used in real-time graphics employ a special algorithm for retouching, and generating effects in real-time.
YEBIS is middleware that enables such post-effects.
